SQL Course

Throughout this course, I was taught various topics and then was given exams based on business questions and had to write custom SQL queries to answer them. If you wish to view the course by section, I listed the document by section. The course can be broken up into 3 sections:


1.	SQL Statement Fundamentals, Aggregate Functions

2.	JOINS, Timestamps and Extract, Mathematical Functions, String Function and Operators, SubQuery, Self-Join

3.	Final Project: Creating and editing databases that used the following statements: CREATE, ALTER, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, and CHECK databases, tables and rows

4. Conditional Expressions and Procedures: CASE
