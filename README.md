# SQL Course

Throughout this course, I was taught various topics and then was given exams based on business questions and wrote [custom SQL queries](https://github.com/alexmurrietta/SQL-to-the-SQL/blob/master/SQL_Queries.sql) to answer them. If you wish to view the course by section, I listed the document by section. The course can be broken up into 4 sections:
